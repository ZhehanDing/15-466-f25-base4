You just won the lottery for a free trip to a European small sea village called Gravenmire. 
The name meant nothing to you when you first read it — tucked away somewhere between rocky cliffs 
and gray waters, far from any map you’d ever studied.

The ocean stretched before you — cold, endless, and strangely still.
You are about to breathe in the sea air when you noticed it: 
A blurred shadow standing on the water itself, unmoving, 
its edges rippling like smoke caught between this world and another.

You wake up in a soft bed inside an old seaside hotel, 
the air thick with salt and mildew.  
On the table rests a rusted key marked *Room 6*, 
and outside the window, the waves sound almost like whispers.
>>>
option: Look out the window -> r2
option: Go down stair -> r3
option: Try to go back to sleep -> r4

state: r2
text:
<<<
You push the window open wider, 
and a cold gust carries the brine of the sea into your room.  
Far out on the water, 
a blurred figure stands unmoving on the waves, and you heard "2".
>>>
option: Call out to it -> r5
option: Shut the window quickly -> r6

state: r3

The wooden stairs creak under your feet as you descend into the lobby.  
The place is empty except for a cracked reception desk and the faint smell of wet earth drifting in.  
>>>
option: Ring the dusty bell -> r7
option: Step outside -> r8

state: r4
text:

You roll back into the bed, 
clutching the thin blanket.  
Sleep comes fast, 
but your dreams are filled with drowning whispers and pale hands reaching from the sea. 
>>>
option: Jolt awake in terror -> r9
option: Let the dream carry you -> r9

state: r5
text:

You shout across the waves, 
but your voice comes back doubled, 
as if echoed by something inside your own head.  
The figure lifts one arm, 
and the wind hisses a single word: “One.”  
>>>
option: Keep calling -> r13
option: Retreat from the window -> r14


state: r6
text:

You slam the window shut, 
the glass rattling in its old frame.  
For a moment the room is silent,
but then a faint knocking begins from inside the walls.  
>>>
option: Investigate the sound -> r15
option: Run out of the room -> r3

state: r7
text:
<<<
You tap the dusty bell, 
and its chime echoes far too long, 
vibrating in your bones.  
From behind the desk, 
something shifts — not a person, 
but a wet, 
pale hand dragging itself into view.  
>>>
option: If you know it’s poison, then there's no point drinking it. -> r10
option: Maybe it’s better to let someone else drink it. -> r12

state: r8

You step outside into the fog, 
the lamps flickering with a sickly yellow glow.  
The crawling shapes emerge — their limbs bend backward, 
eyes rolling white, and their teeth gnash in rhythm with the sea.
>>>
option: Run away -> intro6

state: r9
text:

You find yourself are inside of the gray ocean, 
you can clear see the blurred figure now, 
a towering shape with hundred arms, 
thousand pure white fish eyes around them.

option: Swim away -> r11  
option: Try to wake up -> r11

The pale hand rises, 
dragging a figure slick with seawater, 
its skin bloated and split like drowned flesh.  
A mouth rips open across its chest, 
letting out a gurgling hymn of the deep.

option: Run upstairs -> r18
option: Let it see you -> r19

The hand withdraws, 
leaving behind a glass brimming with black water that reeks of brine.  
In its surface, 
your reflection grins madly, 
blood running from your eyes. 
>>>
option: Drink the black water -> r11
option: Smash the glass -> r20


state: r13
text:

You keep calling, louder, 
your throat burning.  
The blurred figure lowers its arm. 
The word “Zero” rattles through your skull.  
The window glass splinters as if struck from the outside.
You open your eyes wide.   
>>>
option: [You become one of them] -> game_start
option: Stay frozen and watch -> r19

state: r14
text:

You stagger back from the window, 
heart hammering.  
The whispers don’t stop — they follow you across the room, 
seeping through the floorboards.  
The key on the table vibrates, 
rattling against the wood.  
>>>
option: Pick up the key -> r21  
option: Leave the room immediately -> r3

state: r15
text:
<<<
You press your ear to the wall.  
The knocking grows louder, 
until it sounds like something is inside with you.  
A crack splits across the plaster, 
and a pale, lidless eye stares out.  
>>>
option: Tear open the wall -> r22  
option: Run for the stairs -> r3

state: r18
text:
<<<
You rush back upstairs, 
stumbling into the hallway.  
The wallpaper peels as if rotting before your eyes, 
and every door reads *Room 6*.  
No matter which handle you grasp, 
the corridor twists back to where you started.  
>>>
option: Keep running -> r23  
option: Collapse and wait -> r24

state: r19
text:
<<<
The drowned figure notices you.  
It smiles with too many teeth, 
and whispers slip straight into your skull:  
“You cannot leave.”  
Your vision flickers, and you are back at the window, 
staring at the blurred figure on the sea.  
>>>
option: Surrender to the vision -> r25  
option: Fight to close your eyes -> r9

state: r20
text:

The glass shatters in your hand, 
black water spilling like oil across the floor.  
The liquid slithers instead of pooling, 
crawling back toward the door as if alive.

option: Follow the trail -> r23  
option: Stay and watch -> r24

state: r21
text:
<<<
The key is freezing cold, 
biting into your palm.  
Numbers swirl in your mind — 6, 2, 0, 1 — before dissolving into whispers.  
You feel a compulsion to go back outside to the beach.  
>>>
option: Obey the pull -> r26  
option: Resist -> r23

state: r22
text:
<<<
You rip open the wall, 
and a rush of saltwater floods out.  
The eye blinks once, then vanishes into the torrent.  
The room drowns in gray water, pulling you toward the sea.
>>>
option: Let it drag you -> r1  
option: Try to swim against it -> r11

state: r23
text:

You wander, hallways bending and stretching, 
each step echoing like you walk inside a seashell.  
The fog curls in through cracks in the wood, 
and before long you’re back at the beach again.

option: Wait at the beach -> r26  
option: Walk into the sea -> r1

state: r24
text:

You sink to the floor, body trembling, 
while the whispers rise into a chorus.  
When you open your eyes, 
you are already sitting at the edge of the beach, 
the tide brushing your feet.  
>>>
option: Keep waiting -> r26  
option: Step forward -> r1

state: r25
text:

The whispers become silence.  
When you open your eyes, the hotel, 
the window, 
even the sea is gone.  
You stand on the empty beach, 
waiting… and waiting.

option: Continue waiting -> r26

You decide to continue wait in here, wait for that ancient one shows up.
You don't feel hungry, you just sit there and wait.
Sun raise and down over and over.
You can't feel you hand and feet gradually, you mind stop thinking.
You become part of the beach.
